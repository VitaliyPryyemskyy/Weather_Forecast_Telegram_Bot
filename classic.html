                Yes, there are hundreds of classic cocktails. But few have true staying power. Those that do are drinks
                as
                popular in the modern era as they were a century (or two) ago. Not to mention, they frequently form the
                source of inspiration for dozens of riffs, so it’s good to get familiar with the originals.
            </p>
            <p>Everyone has their preferences, but no matter whether your go-to is gin, tequila, or rye whiskey, the
                drinks
                listed here transcend predilection. They are the classic cocktails every self-proclaimed cocktail lover
                should
                get to know. There’s a perfect time and place for each and every one of them.</p>

                If you like piña colada, you should know the famous tropical drink was invented in Puerto Rico! The
                sweet mix of coconut cream, pineapple juice, white rum, and ice was born in San Juan, but the
                identity of its creator is still an unresolved controversy on the island.

            <p> It wouldn't have been called a Mojito in these early days, so it's possible that the African slaves were
                not the ones to invent the drink, but the ones to give it its modern name. The spanish word “mojadito”
                (meaning “a little wet”) and the Cuban lime-based seasoning “mojo” are other possible explanations for
                the name.</p>

            <p> Daiquirí is also the name of a beach and an iron mine near Santiago de Cuba, and is a word of Taíno
                origin.
                The drink was supposedly invented by an American mining engineer named Jennings Cox, who was in Cuba
                (then
                at the tail-end of the Spanish Captaincy-General government) at the time of the Spanish–American War.
